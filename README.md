hELLO;

this is a C++ program merged with mysql database management system, 
to store the attendance of registered students in an institution.

the requirements for this program to execute on your machine are:
- mysql server and client
- IDE (codeblocks/devcpp)
- required header files for mysql (mysql.h)
- windows Operating system (this project works only on windows as it requires
  the windows.h header file)

* to configure mysql and codeblocks is not easy at all, but follow the instructions
  in this link and you'll have a better understanding.

1) Run the sql script to create the database and it's tables
2) Run the cpp program ( this program provides more functionality when the
   database is connected, meaning your have to make sure the database connects)

HOW IT WORKS;
There are two types of users (ADMIN, STUDENT).
- The student, after bieng authenticated can view his/her attendance
- The admin, after bieng authenticated can add, delete, read and update student 
  information in the database.
